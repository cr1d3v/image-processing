## The Project Idea 

The following repository comprises 7 - exercise questions all covering different aspects of image processing, more specifically:
- Image Representation
- Image Statistics
- Histograms and Thresholding
- Contrast Manipulation
- Morphological Operators
- Rotation and Scaling
- Nonlinear Spatial
- Linear Spatial Domain Filters
- Edge Detection and Correlation
- Steganography
- Spatial Frequency 

The exercise questions were completed with the help of [Matlab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB) programming language. Primarily with the aim of less is more, prioritizing the reduction of bloated code as much as possible as well as ensuring that the written applications are concise and efficient and that unnecessary work is not done in the background. Larger programs were broken into functions, the code is extensively commented and care has been taken when naming variables by not using verbs.
<br>
<br>
Due to the amount of content covered in each question, I made sure to include a 'presentation.pdf' file along with every exercise folder extensively describing the goal of each exercise/results achieved.
<br>
<br>
Lastly, the last folder marked as 'q7' is a working automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) system.

How can the following application be improved?
<br>
While this is a working solution, the application will require further extensive testing under different weather and time-of-day conditions. Admittedly, it does fail to recognize certain test videos while it does a great job at working perfectly fine with others.
